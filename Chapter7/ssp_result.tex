\section{Results}
In this section, we show experimental results in predicting the several important social signals from different input sources. The core direction in performing this experiments is to explore the correlations of diverse behavioral channels measured in genuine social communications. We leverage the wide spectrum social signal measurements of the Haggling dataset, and train neural network models to predict the social signals of the target person, including speaking status, social formations (positions and orientations), and body gestures.

\subsection{Pre-processing Haggling Data}
Given the motion data of the Haggling games, we first annotate the start and end time of the game, where the start time is decided when the social formation is built and the end time is defined when the social formation is broken. We crop out the motion dataset based on this start and end time, so that we ignore the time while subjects enter and exit the capture space. For each haggling game scene we also annotate the roles in the game, buyer, left-seller, and right-seller, where the left and right are determined in the buyer's viewpoint. In our experiment, we specify that the left seller is our target person and predict the social behavior of these subjects. Following the work of~\cite{holden2016deep}, we re-target the motion data to a standardized skeleton size to remove size variation from the body skeletons. We also synthesize footstep signals and decouple the body motion from global translation and orientation using the method of ~\cite{holden2016deep}. Finally, we divide the dataset into 140 training sets and 40 test sets. However, since there exist sequences where the reconstruction errors are severe for some frames, we select only 79 training sets and 28 testing sets which are manually verified to be error free. Although our dataset captures face and body signals, we do not include these data in our current experiments.

\subsection{Speaking Status Prediction}
We predict whether the target person is currently speaking or not by observing other social signals in the scene. First, we investigate the performance when the target individual's own social signals are used as input. Three different input sources--facial expressions, body gestures, and both of them---are used to train neural network models respectively. In particular, we use the same neural network architecture for this experiment by keeping the input dimension and network size to make the comparison as fair as possible. More specifically, we use the``body2speak" model in \ref{section:body2speak}, by modifying the input dimension into the concatenation of face and body signals (with $5+73$ dimensions). To test with only the body signals as input, we mask out the face signal part in the input with their average values. Similarly, we mask out the body part in the input to test with the face signal only.  The prediction accuracies from these input signals are shown in the first column of Table ~\ref{table:speaking_class}. In our result, the facial cue of the target person shows the strongest correlation (about $90\%$ accuracy) with the target person's own speaking status, presumably due to the strong correlation between the lip motion and speaking. The body motion also shows a strong correlation with more than $76\%$ prediction accuracy. The result with both body and face signals is similar to the face only case, showing that the face signal presumably dominates in this task.

Another interesting experiment is performed by using the other seller's social signals as input to predict the target person's speaking status. Similarly, three different input sources are considered. The result clearly shows that there exists a strong link between interpersonal social signals. The other seller's facial motion shows a strong predictive power for the target person's speaking status, presumably due to the turn-taking property in social communication. For example, we can assume that the target person is not speaking, when the other seller is speaking.

We also perform the experiment using social signals from a random individual, where the individual is randomly selected in the testing set. As expected, the classification performance using a random person's motion as input shows about the chance level (50\%).

%We compare the binary speaking classification performance . The task is to classify the speaking status of the target person, and we use three different body motion sources: (1) the target person's own body motion, (2) the other seller's body motion, (3) a random person's body motion. As shown in the results, the own body motion has the strongest correlation, but the other seller's body motion is also very predictive, showing that there exists a clear social link during their interaction. As expected, the classification performance using a random person's motion as input shows about the chance level (50\%). For the experiment (3), we use the same network trained for (2), but use the body motion from a subject in some other arbitrary sequence (excluding our current target sequence) as input. Presumably, the classification method using the other person's body signals learns the ``turn-taking" property in the social interaction, and predicts that the target person is speaking if little motion is observed from the other sellers (who would be listening). %This kind of study is important to make machines better understand human social behaviors, and can be facilitated from the data where natural social interactions are captured.  %This kin %shows an interesting insight that the body motions % the strong correlation of social signals can be used as a prior for predicting human behaviors.

\subsection{Social Formation Prediction (Position and Orientation)}
We predict the position and orientation of the target person, the ``left seller", by using the signals of communication partners. In this test, we explore the prediction accuracy by considering combinations of difference sources: using body position, body orientation, and face orientations. Table~\ref{table:predForm_errors} shows the results. By using all signals, we obtain the best performance. Intuitively, we can imagine that the target person's location can be estimated by triangulating the face normal direction of the other two subjects, which presumably learnt from our network. The prediction performance using only position cues shows the worst performance among them. 

We also introduce a baseline. The baseline method (denoted as ``Mirroring" in Table~\ref{table:predForm_errors}) predicts the location of the target seller to mirror that of the other seller w.r.t the buyer's body orientation, and estimate body orientation as the average between the two input subjects. The face orientation is chosen to always face the buyer. This baseline has large errors, with poor prediction results when the buyer is directly facing the other sellers, making the target person be too close to the other seller. 

%Our method shows a 25 cm error in the prediction, which is better than a baseline. As the baseline, we predict the location of the target seller to mirror that of the other seller w.r.t the buyer's body orientation, and estimate body orientation as the average between the two input subjects. The face orientation is chosen to always face the buyer (denoted as ``Mirroring" in Table~\ref{table:predForm_errors}). We also perform an ablation study to see what information is important to get better accuracy. To do this, we change the channel of the input, as in Table~\ref{table:predForm_errors}. We use the same network  but set unused input channels to their mean values in the training set. This experiment demonstrates that social formation estimation can take advantages from the body and face orientation signals. Intuitively, we can imagine that the target person's location can be estimated by triangulating the face normal direction of the other two subjects. To compute errors of orientations, we compute the 2D distance between the unit vectors representing the orientation estimation and the ground truth normal directions of face or body.% In Fig.~\ref{fig:predForm_errors}, the average position errors of each sequences are shown.

\subsection{Revisiting Proxemics}
An interesting experiment is to consider the well-know theories in psychology again using the new data we collected in our sensor system. Our dataset has the measurement of fully spontaneous motions (including the position and orientation of groups) of interacting people, and enables us to revisit the well-known proxemics theory~\cite{Hall66}. We first compute the average distance between a pair of subjects: (1) buyer and right sellers (B-RS), (2) buyer and left seller (B-LS), and (3) left seller and right seller (LS-RS). The results are shown in Table~\ref{table:proxemics_comp}. We found that the result approximately follows the social distance categories defined in the Hall's categorization~\cite{Hall66}. The distances among sellers are within the close phase of social distance ranges (from 120-210 $cm$) and the average distance among sellers and buyers are within the far phase of social distance (from 210 to 370 $cm$) in \cite{Hall66}. To analyze the shape of the social formation, we plot the average formation of games in a person-centric coordinate by a buyer. The results are shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:socialgeo_distribution}, showing that the formation is often similar to isosceles triangles with relatively far distances between a buyer and two sellers than the distance between sellers.

% \subsection{Correlation between Body, Face, and Hands}

% We use all body parts for communication where each part plays a role to send some specific signals. Unfortunately, these roles are also poorly understood. In this section, we investigate whether there exists patterns or strong correlations among parts. We study this by predicting a missing part given other body parts.
