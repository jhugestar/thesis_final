First and foremost, I am immensely grateful to my advisor, Yaser Sheikh who have been a tireless mentor, counselors, co-authors, and career
advisors. I owe a great intellectual debt to Prof. Yaser Sheikh who has given me tremendous guidance. He has shown the ideal role model as a mentor; he has encouraged me with endless patience that allowed me to focus on my research and to dream of pursuing my academic career. I am honored to have an opportunity to work with him and proud of our work. Also I appreciate my committee members including Prof. Jessica Hodgins, Prof. Kenji Shimada, Prof. Levent Burak Kara, and Prof. Christoph Bregler for their valuable comments and advice. I am fortunate to collaborate with many researchers from Disney Research Pittsburgh, Intel, and Microsoft Research. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Dr. Shiratori who has played a key role to build my insight on structure from motion that constitutes the basis of my thesis. Also I thank all our group members for their advice and help, including Natasha Kholgade, Tomas Simon, Varun Ramakrishna, Yair Movshovitz-Attias, Minh Vo, Zijun Wei, and Hanbyul Joo. I am indebted to the KDisTech members including Sungwook Yang, Junsung Kim, Jongho Lee, and Hyunggi Cho, who have broadened my research horizon. Finally, I would like to express my great appreciation to my family, in particular, my beloved wife, Soo Jin Kang for her tireless support and sacrifices.
