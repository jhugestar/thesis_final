I am immensely grateful to my advisor Yaser Sheikh who has been an ideal mentor, teacher, and collaborator. Without his encouragement and guidance, this thesis work would not have been possible. I also greatly appreciate my thesis committee members Takeo Kanade,  Louis-Philippe Morency, David Forsyth, and Mina Cikara for their valuable comments and advice.

In particular, I would like to thank Hyun Soo Park who guided me at the beginning of my PhD and has been a counselor throughout the years. I've been fortunate to have many collaborators in materializing the Panoptic Studio: Tomas Simon, Xulong Li, Hao Liu, Lei Tan, Lin Gui, Sean Banerjee, Timothy Godisart, Bart Nabbe, and Iain Matthews. I also thank all of our current and previous group members: Minh Vo, Aayush Bansal, Varun Ramakrishna, Yair Movshovitz-Attias, Natasha Kholgade Banerjee, Donglai Xiang, Gines Hidalgo, Shih-En Wei, Zhe Cao, Luona Yang, Gaku Nakano, Xiu Li, Raaj Yaadhav, Haroon Idrees. I've been also fortunate to collaborate with Thabo Beeler, Derek Bradley, and Chenglei Wu during my internship at Disney Research Zurich and many researchers at Facebook Reality Labs, Pittsburgh. I would like to express my great appreciation to Jessica Hodgins, Kris Kitani, Srinivasa Narasimhan, Abhinav Gupta, Deva Ramanan, Fernando De la Torre, and John Oâ€™brien, for discussions, help, and advice.

My final thanks go to my family: my parents, parents-in-law, my brother, brothers-in-law, and, in particular, my beloved wife, Sooyeon Lee, and our children, Ian and Erin, for their tireless support and sacrifices.
